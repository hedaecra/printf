.SH NAME
printf \- Formatted output conversion recreated printf C standard library function.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \(dqmain.h\(dq
.sp
.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
The functions in _printf() writes output according to a format.

.SH Format
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written.

.TP
.BR b
The int argument is converted to a binary.

.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but do ot include the terminating null byte.

.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal.

.TP
.B r
Prints a string in reverse.

.TP
.B R
Prints a string converted to rot13.

.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'.

.SH Example:
To use the _printf function you simply need to compile all files .c including the header holberton.h with a main function.

.B main.c
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
 _printf("let's print something using our function!");

 return (0);
 }

.B Compilation:
 $ gcc *.c -o

.B Output:
let's print something using our function!

.SH Return Value
In case of success _printf returns an integer value, wich is the total number of printed characters.
Otherwise, _printf returns -1 (error).

.SH NOTES
Actualy, the program don't handle the flag characters, field width, precision nor the length modifiers.
_printf uses a custom character printing function called _putchar, that uses the system call write().
_putchar uses a static buffer of 1024 bytes and a static incrementing variable.
That way, everytime _putchar is called inside _printf, the character is stored inside the buffer and the function moves to the next character,
until _printf calls _putchar(-1), which \(dqflushes\(dq the buffer and resets the incrementing variable to 0.
That way, _putchar only needs to call write one time, passing to it the whole buffer and the number of bytes in it, which is given by the value of the incrementing variable.
